Welcome!  I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. I am advised by Dr Randal Burns and Dr Joshua Vogelstein. 
My research focuses on systems optimizations for machine learning applications. In particular I study storage and I/O bottlenecks 
in machine learning algorithms.

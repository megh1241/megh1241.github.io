### Bio 
Welcome to my website!  I am a 5th year PhD candidate in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. My research lies at the intersection of systems and machine learning. Specifically, I look at I/O and data movement bottlenecks in machine learning algorithms. I am fortunate to be advised by Dr Randal Burns and Dr Joshua Vogelstein. During my PhD I spent summers at Meta (2021) and Argonne National Laboratory (2022). Prior to joining JHU, I earned my BS and MS degrees at the International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore. Contact me at <firstname>@jhu.edu for questions about research or potential collobarations.

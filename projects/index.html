          <b>Mentor: Dr Manish Gupta, former head of Xerox research India and Infosys Chair Professor
at International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore. </b>
          <p>  <font size="2">Inferring pre-requisite relations between educational concepts is important to enable educational technology
applications such as personalized recommendations and automatic curriculum creation. 
In this project, we introduce PREREQ, a new supervised learning method for inferring concept prerequisite relations
using latent representations of concepts obtained from the Pairwise Latent Dirichlet Allocation model, to train a neural net-
work based on the Siamese Network architecture. PREREQ can learn unknown concept prerequisites from course prerequisites
and labeled and unlabelled concept prerequisite data. This project culminated in a paper which is currently under review. </font size></p>

	  <b> Mentor: Dr Bertrand Thirion, Head of Parietal Lab at INRIA Saclay </b>
          <p>  <font size="2">Human studies performed with functional MRI are most often easier than animal studies and 
can be used to probe the full repertoire of high-level cognitive functions. While the analysis of data specific to a given experiment is a relatively well-mastered process, a serious limitation is the difficulty to compare data across multiple datasets, as they require to pool together brain images acquired under different settings and assess the effect of different
experimental conditions that correspond to psychological effects studied by neuroscientists. In this work we set up a machine learning framework that takes as input large collections of images and a description of the associated protocols, and returns topographical representations associated with these concepts. We consider a basic General Linear Model Y = BX + E where Y is a set of brain activation maps,
X a binary matrix denoting a set of psycological concepts and B coefficients mapping the two. We compare this model with two alternative models
i.e a mixed effects model which captures between study variability by introducing an additive variable as well as another model which 
introduces a multiplicative variable. We benchmark these alternate solutions with the first and tabulate the results. </font size></p>

          <h3>A Low Cost Personalised Robot Language Tutor with Perceptual and Interaction Capabilities</h3>
          <b> Mentor: Dr Dinesh Babu Jayagopi, Head of Multimodal Perception Lab IIITB and Professor at IIITB </b>
          <p>  <font size="2">In this work, we design and implement a prototype for a robot language tutor which has perceptual and interaction capabilities.
We use a  Pan-Tilt-Zoom robotic camera and programmed the camera to track faces and move in the direction of a given head position. 
The system consisted of the following components:
- Face, age and gender recognition
- Object detection and recognition using Deep Learning
- Speech recognition and synthesis
- Head pose estimation and eye gaze estimation
 This research culminated in the paper "A Low Cost Personalised Robot Language Tutor with Perceptual and Interaction Capabilities" which has been published in the proceedings of the 13th IEEE Annual India Conference (INDICON) 2016. </font size></p>

          <b>Mentor: Dr Shrisha Rao, Professor at IIITB  </b>
          <p>  <font size="2">In this work, we devise a novel distributed algorithm for computing the TrustRank of a webpage. TrustRank is an algorithm developed by Dr Haveliwala at Stanford. It is a semi automatic algorithm which uses the link structure of the web to identify spam webpages. A distributed algorithm will make the computation much quicker and more efficient. We first describe how Monte Carlo methods can be used for the computation of the biased PageRank algorithm. We then propose a distributed algorithm for computing the TrustRank. Ours is the first attempt at a distributed solution to this problem. We submitted this work to a conference and it is currently under review. </font size></p>

          <b>Mentor: Dr Shrisha Rao, Professor at IIITB  </b>
          <p>  <font size="2">We propose a novel distributed approach for the problem of scheduling a fleet of autonomous vehicles. Our
distributed system avoids a single point of failure, is scalable, fault tolerant and robust. We describe an agent-based distributed
system to conduct a set of procurement auctions. This work has been published in the proceedings of the 2017 IEEE International Conference on Service Operations and Logistics and Informatics (SOLI). </font size></p>

          <h3>Prediction of susceptibility to a virus</h3>
	  <b>Mentor: Dr G Srinivasaraghavan, Professor at IIITB  </b>
          <p>  <font size="2">Predict which individuals become infected with virus and are contagious following nasal exposure to a virus. In order to predict this, an intermediate task is to identify early-stage gene expression markers of susceptibility to respiratory viral infections and contagiousness. This is quantified by measuring shedding of virus from nasal passages on subsequent days post exposure. The binary valued target outcome that we must predict is whether or not a given patient exhibits viral shedding after viral exposure for different points in time. </font size></p>
